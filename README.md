This is made public for you to view but is not recommended to use without testing first!

##Setup
Move configs/config-example.json to configs/config.json and complete the config!
Place all the servers in their own folder with the name you gave them in the config. This is not the friendly name.
Add any commands you wish and set the all option so users not in the allowed-list can run it.
allow-anyone is used so that the default commands can be given the option to only be run by the allowed-list.


##Advanced
Use the directory option if the folder of the launch jar is not in the base folder of the server.
E.G servers/example/minecraft/ would have a directory of minecraft/
